# Financial Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a financial-domain sentiment analysis framework developed during my quantitative research internship at CPIC Fund Management. It integrates **large language models (LLMs)**, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiment in stock-related text and support sentiment-driven investment strategies.

## Key Features
- **Fine-Tuned GPT Model:** Adapted a finance-domain GPT for sentiment classification, relation extraction, headline classification, and named entity recognition (NER).
- **Data Preprocessing & Annotation:** Curated and labeled task-specific NLP datasets; translated non-English text for analysis; ensured high-quality, consistent annotations to improve model performance.
- **Sentiment Scoring & Grouping:** Applied sentiment analysis tools to assign scores to stock descriptions and grouped them into positive, negative, and neutral clusters for downstream strategy research.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python (PyTorch, Hugging Face):** Model fine-tuning and deployment.
- **Pandas, NLTK, Deep Translator:** Data cleaning, tokenization, translation, and sentiment scoring.
- **REST API Development:** Exposed model predictions to internal teams for live testing and integration.

## Impact
The framework enabled CPIC analysts to extract sentiment signals from unstructured financial text and explore their potential in quantitative investment strategies. It illustrates the application of advanced AI and NLP techniques in real-world financial research.
